                        Most meaningful decisions aren't made with perfect data. They're made with partial information, under time pressure, and within real constraints like regulatory requirements, legacy systems, competing priorities, and people who need answers now.
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-text">
                        My work sits at the intersection of software systems, analytics, and business judgment. I focus on building reliable infrastructure, questioning data quality, and translating analysis into decisions that matter. The goal isn't to eliminate uncertainty but to navigate it thoughtfully and to keep improving how decisions get made.

                                <h4>The Business Context</h4>
                                <p>Healthcare workflows depend on production-grade backend services that need to be available and responsive. When APIs are slow or unavailable, it affects patient care, provider operations, and business processes. Teams needed visibility into system health and the ability to identify issues before they impacted users.</p>
                                <h4>The Constraints</h4>
                                <p>Scalable systems handled millions of requests per month across distributed infrastructure. Issues could originate from multiple sources like application code, infrastructure, dependencies, or data problems. Teams needed to detect problems quickly but also needed context to understand root causes. Alert fatigue was a real concern because too many alerts and teams would ignore them.</p>
                                <h4>The Approach</h4>
                                <p>Built monitoring dashboards that tracked key metrics including request volume, latency, error rates, and dependency health. Implemented alerting that focused on business impact rather than raw metrics, reducing noise while improving detection speed. Created runbooks that documented common issues and resolution steps, helping teams respond faster to incidents. Conducted root-cause analysis on production issues to identify patterns and prevent recurrence.</p>
                                <h4>The Outcome</h4>
                                <p>Reduced mean time to detection by providing clear visibility into system health. Helped teams resolve incidents faster through better context and documentation. Improved system reliability by identifying and addressing recurring issues.</p>

                                <p>Ford needed to understand credit risk across its auto loan portfolio to make informed decisions about lending criteria, collections strategies, and capital allocation. Risk patterns varied by region, customer segment, and loan characteristics.</p>
                                <h4>The Constraints</h4>
                                <p>Credit data came from multiple sources with varying quality and timeliness. Models needed to perform consistently across different geographies and customer segments. Risk assessments needed to be explainable to support business decisions. Stakeholders needed timely visibility into portfolio health without manual data pulls.</p>
                                <h4>The Approach</h4>
                                <p>Built analytical models to estimate delinquency risk and probability of default using credit scores, repayment history, and borrower characteristics. Validated model performance across different segments using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics. Segmented borrowers into risk tiers to support targeted monitoring and collections strategies. Created dashboards that communicated risk trends to finance and operations teams.</p>
                                <h4>The Outcome</h4>
                                <p>Enabled more informed decisions about lending criteria and collections resource allocation. Reduced time spent on manual reporting, allowing teams to focus on analysis and action. Improved visibility into portfolio risk trends across regions and segments.</p>

                            I use AI when it meaningfully improves how I work, particularly in making sense of ambiguity, accelerating early analysis, or surfacing patterns in data that would otherwise take longer to uncover. As AI capabilities continue to evolve, I see it as a powerful way to improve efficiency and broaden perspective in the early stages of problem-solving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm deliberate about where I apply it. When simpler analytical approaches are more reliable, or when explainability and transparency are critical, I rely on traditional methods and human judgment. In high-stakes or regulated contexts, AI supports analysis rather than driving conclusions, and outputs are always validated and documented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AI is a tool, not a substitute for thinking. Its value lies in helping me move faster, ask better questions, and identify angles I might have missed, while the core work remains the same: understanding the problem, questioning the data, and translating insights into decisions that people can trust and act on.

                                <p class="experience-description">
                                    I analyzed promotional campaigns to help the lottery understand what was working and what wasn't. The challenge was separating signal from noise—figuring out whether sales increases were due to promotions or other factors like seasonality or external events.
                                </p>
                                <p class="experience-description">
                                    I built models to estimate promotion effectiveness, looking at metrics like redemption rates, incremental sales, and ROI. The work involved designing experiment-style analyses and segmenting customers to identify which groups responded to different types of promotions.
                                </p>
                                <p class="experience-description">
                                    The goal was to help stakeholders make better decisions about promotional spend—identifying what to continue, what to adjust, and what to stop. I created dashboards and reports that translated analysis into actionable insights, helping reduce spending on underperforming campaigns.

                                    I analyzed credit and repayment data to help Ford understand borrower risk across different regions. The work involved building models to estimate delinquency risk and probability of default, then validating those models to ensure they performed consistently across different customer segments and geographies.

                                    I segmented borrowers into risk tiers to support portfolio monitoring and risk management decisions.

                                    I worked with internal teams to identify opportunities for automation and process improvement across enterprise workflows. The work involved understanding how teams were currently doing things, identifying bottlenecks and manual steps, and designing solutions that reduced effort and improved turnaround time.

I used AI-assisted tools, including LLM-based agents and APIs, to validate and standardize address data from inconsistent formats—reducing manual review time while maintaining data quality through validation rules.
